# Script to measure performance of different modes in TME3
#
# Usage: ./measurePerf.sh [FILE] [EXE]
#   - FILE: Input text file to parse (default: WarAndPeace.txt)
#   - EXE: Path to the TME3 executable (default: ./build-release/TME3)
#
# Invocation example:
#   ./measurePerf.sh WarAndPeace.txt ./build/TME3 > perf.txt
#
# Description:
#   This script runs the TME3 word frequency counter in various modes and thread counts.
#   It tests single-threaded modes (freqstd, freqstdf, freq) once each.
#   For multi-threaded modes, it loops over thread counts 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 32, 64.
#   Output includes timing info from 'time' command for single modes, and program output for multi.
#   Redirect stdout to a file (e.g., perf.txt) to capture results for further processing.
#
# I/O:
#   - Input: Reads the specified FILE.
#   - Output: Prints test results and timings to stdout.
#
# Adaptation:
#   - Modify SINGLE_MODES or MULTI_MODES arrays to add/remove modes.
#   - Change THREADS array for different thread counts.
#   - Adjust EXE path if built in a different location (e.g., ./build/TME3).
#   - For release builds, ensure EXE points to optimized binary.
